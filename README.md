# Drawing-Robot-V2

This is a project to create a robotic arm that is able to draw simple images. The goal is to create software that is able to take in an image file and draw it using a robotic arm controlled by an Arduino (Probably the Arduino Uno). It is very much in progress right now. Most of the code for moving the arm is in place. The primary objective right now is establishing communication with the Arduino and converting an image into a set of instructions for the arm.

Objectives:
 - Add (way) more comments
 - Fix issue with accuracy map
 - Make diagrams so it is easier to understand the math
 - Set up communication with the Arduino
 - Finish building the robotic arm
 - Create UML diagram

Hurdles:
 - Need a separate power supply for the servos
